# PMK
Perception and Manipulation knowledge framework (PMK) presents a standardized ontology framework for autonomous robot perception and manipulation, which follows the IEEE standards 1872 of representing knowledge for the robotic domain. Moreover, an inference mechanism for reasoning over the knowledge is included, which enhances the planning of manipulation tasks.
